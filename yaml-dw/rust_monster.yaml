description: "A very distinctive-looking creature. Something like a reddish\
  \ cricket, I think. Long crickety legs, anyhow. Blind, too, as I understand\
  \ it\u2014they feel their way around with those long moth-looking tendrils.\
  \ Feed that way, too. Sift through piles of metal for the choicest bits.\
  \ That\u2019s what they eat, don\u2019t matter the type, neither. Their\
  \ merest touch turns it all to rusted flakes. Magic lasts longer but under\
  \ the scrutiny of a rust monster, it\u2019s a foregone conclusion. Only\
  \ the gods know where they came from, but they\u2019re a curse if you\
  \ value your belongings."
