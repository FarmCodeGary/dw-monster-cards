description: "\u201CThe excavation uncovered what the reports called a basalt\
  \ gate. Black stone carved with molten runes. When they dug it up, the\
  \ magi declared it inert but further evidence indicates that was an incorrect\
  \ claim. The entire team went missing. When we arrived, the gate was glowing.\
  \ Its light filled the whole cavern. We could see from the entrance that\
  \ the area had become full of these creatures\u2014like men with red and\
  \ orange skin, tall as an ogre but with a snake\u2019s tail where their\
  \ legs ought to be. They were clothed, too\u2014some had black glass armor.\
  \ They spoke to each other in a tongue that sounded like grease in a fire.\
  \ I wanted to leave but the sergeant wouldn\u2019t listen. You\u2019ve\
  \ already read what happened next, sir. I know I\u2019m the only one that\
  \ got back, but what I said is true. The gate is open, now. This is just\
  \ the beginning!\u201D"
