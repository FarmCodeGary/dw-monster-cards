description: "Do you think the phrase \u201Cdrag him to hell\u201D means\
  \ nothing? It is unfortunately literal, in the case of the chain devil.\
  \ Appearing differently to each victim, this summoned creature has but\
  \ a single purpose: to wrap its victim up in binding coils and take it\
  \ away to a place of torment. Sometimes it will come as a man-shaped mass\
  \ of rusting iron, hooks and coils of mismatched links. Other times, a\
  \ roiling tangle of rope or kelp or twisted bloody bedsheets. The results\
  \ are always the same."
