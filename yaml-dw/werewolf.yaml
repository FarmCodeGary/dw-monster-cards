description: "\u201CBeautiful, isn\u2019t it? The moon, I mean. She\u2019\
  s watching us, you know? Her pretty silver eyes watch us while we sleep.\
  \ Mad, too\u2014like all the most beautiful ones. If she were a woman,\
  \ I\u2019d bend my knee and make her my wife on the spot. No, I didn\u2019\
  t ask you here to speak about her, though. The chains? For your safety,\
  \ not mine. I\u2019m cursed, you see. You must have suspected. The sorcerer-kings\
  \ called it \u201Clycanthropy\u201D in their day\u2014passed on by a bite\
  \ to make more of our kind. No, I could find no cure. Please, don\u2019\
  t be scared. You have the arrows I gave you? Silver, yes. Ah, you begin\
  \ to understand. Don\u2019t cry, sister. You must do this for me. I cannot\
  \ bear more blood on my hands. You must end this. For me.\u201D"
