description: "We fear them, because they call to us. So much like us, or\
  \ how we hope to be: beautiful, passionate, and powerful. They are drawn\
  \ to us for what they cannot be: warm, kind, and alive. These tormented\
  \ souls can only hope, at most, to pass their dreadful curse along. Every\
  \ time they feed they run the risk of passing along their torture to another\
  \ and in each one lives the twisted seed of its creator. Vampires beget\
  \ vampires. Suffering begets suffering. Do not be drawn in by their seduction\
  \ or you may be given their gift\u2014a crown of shadows and the chains\
  \ of eternal undying grief."
