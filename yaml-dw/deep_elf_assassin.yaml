description: 'It was not so simple a thing as a war over religion or territory.
  No disagreement of queens led to the great sundering of the elves. It
  was sadness. It was the very diminishing of the world by the lesser races.
  The glory of all the elves had built was cracking and turning to glass.
  Some, then, chose to separate themselves from the world; wracked with
  tears they turned their backs on men and dwarves. There were others, though,
  that were overcome with something new. A feeling no elf had felt before.
  Spite. Hatred filled these elves and twisted them and they turned on their
  weaker cousins. Some still remain after the great exodus below. Some hide
  amongst us with spider-poisoned blades, meting out that strangest of punishments:
  elven vengeance.'
