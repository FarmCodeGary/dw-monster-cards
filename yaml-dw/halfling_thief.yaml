description: "It would be foolish, now, to draw conclusions about folks\
  \ just because they happen to be good at one thing or another. Then again,\
  \ a spade\u2019s a spade, isn\u2019t it. Or maybe just the goodly, soft-and-sweet\
  \ type of Halfling have the mind to stay in their grassy-hill homes and\
  \ aren\u2019t the type you find in the slums and taverns of the mannish\
  \ world. Perhaps they\u2019re there to cut your purse for calling them\
  \ \u201Chalfling\u201D in the first place. Not all take so kindly to the\
  \ title. Or they\u2019re playing a game, pretending to be a child in need\
  \ of alms\u2014and your arrogant eyes can\u2019t even see the difference\
  \ until too late. Well, it matters little. They\u2019re gone with your\
  \ coin before you even realize you deserved it."
