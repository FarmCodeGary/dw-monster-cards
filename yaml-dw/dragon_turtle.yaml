description: "Bakunawa has a brother. Where she is quick to anger and hungry\
  \ for gold, he is slow and sturdy. She is a knife and he is a shield.\
  \ A great turtle that lies in the muck and mire for ages as they pass,\
  \ mud piled upon his back\u2014sometimes trees and shrubs. Sometimes a\
  \ whole misguided clan of goblins will build their huts and cook their\
  \ ratty meals on the shell of the dragon turtle. His snapping jaws may\
  \ be glacier-slow, but they can rend a castle wall. Careful where you\
  \ tread."
