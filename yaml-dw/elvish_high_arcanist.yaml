description: "True elvish magic isn\u2019t like the spells of men. Mannish\
  \ wizardry is all rotes and formulas. They cheat to find the arcane secrets\
  \ that resound all around them. They are deaf to the arcane symphony that\
  \ sings in the woods. Elvish magic requires a fine ear to hear that symphony\
  \ and the voice with which to sing. To harmonize with what is already\
  \ resounding. Men bind the forces of magic to their will; Elves simply\
  \ pluck the strings and hum along. The High Arcanists, in a way, have\
  \ become more and less than any elf. The beat of their blood is the throbbing\
  \ of all magic in this world."
