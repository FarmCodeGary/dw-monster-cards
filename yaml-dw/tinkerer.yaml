description: "It\u2019s said that if you see a tinker on the road and you\
  \ don\u2019t offer him a swig of ale or some of your food that he\u2019\
  ll leave a curse of bad luck behind. A tinker is a funny thing. These\
  \ strange folk often travel the roads between towns with their oddment\
  \ carts and favorite mules. With a ratty dog and always a story to tell.\
  \ Sometimes the mail, too, if you\u2019re lucky and live in a place where\
  \ Queen\u2019s Post won\u2019t go. If you\u2019re kind, maybe they\u2019\
  ll sell you a rose that never wilts or a clock that chimes with the sound\
  \ of faerie laughter. Or maybe they\u2019re just antisocial peddlers.\
  \ You never know, right?"
