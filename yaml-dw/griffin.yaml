description: "On first glance, one might mistake the griffin for another\
  \ magical mistake like the manticore or the chimera. It looks the part,\
  \ doesn\u2019t it? These creatures have the regal haughtiness of a lion\
  \ and the arrogant bearing of an eagle, but they temper those with the\
  \ unshakeable loyalty of both. To earn the friendship of a griffin is\
  \ to have an ally all your living days. Truly a gift, that. If you\u2019\
  re ever lucky enough to meet one be respectful and deferential above all\
  \ else. It may not seem it but they can perceive the subtlest slights\
  \ and will answer them with a sharp beak and talons."
