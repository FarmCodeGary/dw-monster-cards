description: There are chiefs and there are leaders of the tribes among
  the orcs. There are those who rise to seize power and fall under the machinations
  of their foes. There is but one Warchief. One orc in all the horde who
  stands above the rest, bearing the blessings of the One-Eyes and the Shamans
  both. But one who walks with the elements under Night. But one who bears
  the Iron Sword of Ages and carries the ancient grudge against the civil
  races on his shoulders. The Warchief is to be respected, to be obeyed
  and above all else, to be feared. All glory to the Warchief.
