description: "All things come to an end. Reality bleeds from the cut of\
  \ entropy\u2019s knife. At the edge of time itself stand the inevitable.\
  \ Massive, powerful and seemingly carved from star-stuff themselves, the\
  \ inevitable intervene only where magic or calamity have undone the skein\
  \ of fate. Where the arrogant and powerful boil the substance of destiny\
  \ away and seek to undermine the very laws of reality, the inevitable\
  \ arrive to guide things back to the proper order. Unshakable, seemingly\
  \ immune to mortal harm and utterly enigmatic, it is said that the Inevitable\
  \ are all that will remain when time\u2019s long thread has run out."
