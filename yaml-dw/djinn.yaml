description: "\u201CStop rubbing that lamp, you idiot. I do not care what\
  \ you have read, it will not grant you wishes. I brought you here to show\
  \ you something real, something true. See this mural? It shows the ancient\
  \ city. The true city that came before. They called it Majilis and it\
  \ was made of brass by the spirits. They had golem servants and human\
  \ lovers and, in that day, it was said you could trade them a year of\
  \ your life for a favor. We are not here to gather treasure this night,\
  \ fool, we are here to learn. The djinn still sometimes come to these\
  \ places, and you must understand their history if you are to know how\
  \ to behave. They are powerful and wicked and proud and you must know\
  \ them if you hope to survive a summoning. Now, bring the lamp here and\
  \ we will light it, it grows dark and these ruins are dangerous at night.\u201D"
