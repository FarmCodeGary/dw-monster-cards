description: "A seasoned caravan guard learns to listen for the calls of\
  \ a scout or sentry with a keen ear. A few extra seconds after the alarm\
  \ is raised can mean life or death. Different cries mean different responses,\
  \ too\u2014a call of \u201Corcs!\u201D means draw your sword and steady\
  \ for blood but a call of \u201Cbandits!\u201D says you might be able\
  \ to bargain. One alarm from the scouts that always, always means it\u2019\
  s time to pack up, whip your horse and run for the hills? \u201CLAND SHARK!\u201D"
