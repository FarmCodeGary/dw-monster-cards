description: "Ugly, wrinkled bird-folk, these. Once, maybe, in some ancient\
  \ past, they were a race of angelic men from on high, but now they eat\
  \ rats that they fish from the murk with talon-feet and devour with needle-teeth.\
  \ They understand the tongues of men and dwarves but speak in little more\
  \ than gibbering tongues, mimicking the words they hear with mocking laughter.\
  \ It\u2019s a chilling thing to see a beast so close to man or bird but\
  \ not quite either one."
