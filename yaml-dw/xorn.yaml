description: "Dwarf-made elemental garbage muncher. Shaped like a trash\
  \ bin with a radius of arms to feed excess rock and stone into its gaping\
  \ maw. They eat stone and excrete light and heat. Perfect for operating\
  \ a mine or digging out a quarry. Once one gets lost in the sewers below\
  \ a city, though, or in the foundation of a castle? You\u2019re in deep\
  \ trouble. They\u2019ll eat and eat until you\u2019ve got nothing left\
  \ but to collapse the place down on it and move somewhere else. Ask Burrin,\
  \ Son of Fjornnvald, exile from his clan. I bet he could tell you a story\
  \ about a xorn."
