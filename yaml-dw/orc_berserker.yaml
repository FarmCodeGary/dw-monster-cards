description: "Stained in the unholy ritual of Anointing By The Night\u2019\
  s Blood, some warriors of the horde rise to a kind of twisted knighthood.\
  \ They trade their sanity for this honor, stepping halfway into a world\
  \ of swirling madness. This makes berserkers the greatest of their tribe,\
  \ though as time passes, the chaos spreads. The rare berserker that lives\
  \ more than a few years becomes horrible and twisted, growing horns or\
  \ an extra arm with which to grasp the iron cleavers they favor in battle."
