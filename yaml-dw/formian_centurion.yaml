description: "Whether in the form of a legionnaire, part of the formian\
  \ standing army, or as a praetorian guard to the queen, every formian\
  \ hive contains a great number of these most dangerous insectoids. Darker\
  \ in carapace, often scarred with furrows and the ceremonial markings\
  \ that set them apart from their drones, the formian centurions are their\
  \ fighting force and rightly so. Born, bred and living for the singular\
  \ purpose of killing the enemies of their hive, they fight with one mind\
  \ and a hundred swords. Thus far, the powers of Law have seen fit to spare\
  \ mankind a great war with these creatures, but we\u2019ve seen them in\
  \ skirmish\u2014descending sometimes on border towns with their wings\
  \ flickering in the heat or spilling up from a sandy mound to wipe clean\
  \ a newly-dug mine. Theirs is an orderly bloodshed, committed with no\
  \ pleasure but the completion of a goal."
