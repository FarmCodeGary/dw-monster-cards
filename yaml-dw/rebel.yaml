description: "In the countryside they\u2019d be called outlaw and driven\
  \ off or killed. The city, though, is full of places to hide. Damp basements\
  \ to pore over maps and to plan and plot against a corrupt system. Like\
  \ rats, they gnaw away at order, either to supplant it anew or just erode\
  \ the whole thing. The line between change and chaos is a fine one\u2014\
  some rebels walk that thin line and others just want to see it all torched.\
  \ Disguise, a knife in the dark or a thrown torch at the right moment\
  \ are all tools of the rebel. The burning brand of anarchy is a common\
  \ fear amongst the nobles of Dungeon World. These men and women are why."
