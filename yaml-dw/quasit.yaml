description: An imp with some ambition. A quasit is a kind of foot soldier
  in the demon realm. A commoner, armed with fangs or claws or wings or
  some other thing to give it just a little edge over its hellish peers.
  Commonly bound by warlocks to carry heavy loads or build bridges or guard
  their twisted towers, a quasit can take on many forms, none of them pleasant.
