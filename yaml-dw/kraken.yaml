description: "\u201DA cephalo-what? No, boy. Not \u201Ca kraken\u201D but\
  \ \u201Cthe kraken.\u201D I don\u2019t know what nonsense they taught\
  \ you at that school you say you\u2019re from, but here, we know to respect\
  \ the Hungerer. Right, that\u2019s what we call it, The Hungerer in the\
  \ Deep to be more proper. Ain\u2019t no god, though we\u2019ve got those,\
  \ too. It\u2019s a squid! A mighty squid with tentacles thicker \u2018\
  round than a barrel and eyes the size of the full moon. Smart, too, the\
  \ Hungerer. Knows just when to strike\u2014when you\u2019re all too drunk\
  \ or too tired or run out of clean water, that\u2019s when he gets you.\
  \ No, I ain\u2019t ever seen him. I\u2019m alive, aren\u2019t I?\u201D"
