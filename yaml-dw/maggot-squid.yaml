description: "The gods that made this thing were playing some sick joke\
  \ on the civilized folk of the world. The maggot-squid wields a face full\
  \ of horrible squirming tentacles that, if they touch you, feel like being\
  \ struck by lightning. They\u2019ll paralyze you and chew you up slowly\
  \ while you\u2019re helpless. Best to not let it get to that."
