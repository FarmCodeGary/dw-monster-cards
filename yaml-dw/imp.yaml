description: These tiny observer-demons often act as a first-time binding
  subject by neophyte warlocks. They can be found infesting arcane cabals,
  drinking potions when no one watches, and chasing pets and servants with
  tiny pitchforks. A caricature of true demonhood, these little creatures
  are, thankfully, not too difficult to bind or extinguish.
