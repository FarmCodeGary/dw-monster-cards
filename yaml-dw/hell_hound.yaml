description: When one reneges on a deal, does not the debtor come for payment?
  Does the owed party not send someone to collect what is due? So too with
  the Powers Below. They only want what is theirs. A howling pack of shadows,
  flame and jagged bone, driven by the hunting horn. They will not cease,
  they cannot be evaded.
