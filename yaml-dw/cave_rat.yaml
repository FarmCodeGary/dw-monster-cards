description: "Who hasn\u2019t seen a rat before? It\u2019s like that, but\
  \ nasty and big and not afraid of you anymore. Maybe this one was a cousin\
  \ to that one you caught in a trap or the one you killed with a knife\
  \ in that filthy tavern in Darrow. Maybe he\u2019s looking for a little\
  \ ratty revenge."
