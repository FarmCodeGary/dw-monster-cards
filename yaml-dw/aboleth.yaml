description: "Deep below the surface of the world, in freshwater seas untouched\
  \ by the sun, dwell the aboleth. Fish the size of whales, with strange\
  \ growths of gelatinous feelers used to probe the lightless shores. They\u2019\
  re served by slaves: blind albino victims of any race unfortunate enough\
  \ to stumble on them, drained of thought and life by the powers of the\
  \ aboleth\u2019s alien mind. In the depths they plot against each other,\
  \ fishy cultists building and digging upward towards the surface until\
  \ someday, they\u2019ll breach it. For now, they sleep and dream and guide\
  \ their pallid minions to do their bidding."
