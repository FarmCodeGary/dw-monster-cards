description: "Croak croak croak. Little warty munchkins. Some wizard or\
  \ godling\u2019s idea of a bad joke, these creatures are. They stand as\
  \ men, dress in scavenged cloth and hold court in their froggy villages.\
  \ They speak a rumbling pidgin form of the tongue of man and are constantly\
  \ at war with their neighbors. They\u2019re greedy and stupid but clever\
  \ enough when they need to defend themselves. Some say, too, their priests\
  \ have a remarkable skill at healing. Or maybe they\u2019re just really,\
  \ really hard to kill."
