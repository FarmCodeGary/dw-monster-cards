description: "Don\u2019t go thinking that every creature not natural-born\
  \ is a horrible abomination. Don\u2019t imagine for a second that they\u2019\
  re all tentacles and screaming and blood or whatever. Take this noble\
  \ beast, for example. Lovely thing, isn\u2019t it? A fine white horse\
  \ with the wings of a swan. Don\u2019t look like it ought to be able to\
  \ fly, but it does. The elves work miracles, in their own way. They breed\
  \ true\u2014that\u2019s the purity of elf-magic at work. Hatching from\
  \ little crystal eggs and bonded with their riders for life. There\u2019\
  s still some beauty in the world, mark my words."
