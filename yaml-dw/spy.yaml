description: "Beloved of kings but never truly trusted. Mysterious, secretive\
  \ and alluring, the life of a spy is, if you ask a commoner, full of romance\
  \ and intrigue. They\u2019re a knife in the dark and a pair of watchful\
  \ eyes. A spy can be your best friend, your lover or that old man you\
  \ see in the market every day. One never knows. Hells, maybe you\u2019\
  re a spy\u2014they say there\u2019s magic that can turn folks\u2019 minds\
  \ without them ever knowing it. How can we trust you?"
