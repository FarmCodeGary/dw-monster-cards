description: "Respected by all who gaze upon them, the high priests and\
  \ abbesses of Dungeon World are treated with a sort of reverence. Whether\
  \ they pay homage to Ur-thuu-hak, God of Swords, or whisper quiet prayers\
  \ to Namiah, precious daughter of peace, they know a thing or two that\
  \ you and I won\u2019t ever know. The gods speak to them as a hawker-of-wares\
  \ might speak to us in the marketplace. For this, for the bearing-of-secrets\
  \ and the knowing-of-things, we give them a wide berth as they pass in\
  \ their shining robes."
