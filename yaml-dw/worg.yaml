description: "As horses are to the civil races, so go the worg to the goblins.\
  \ Mounts, fierce in battle, ridden by only the bravest and most dangerous,\
  \ are found and bred in the forest primeval to serve the goblins in their\
  \ wars on men. The only safe worg is a pup, separated from its mother.\
  \ If you can find one of these, or make orphans of a litter with a sharp\
  \ sword, you\u2019ve got what could become a loyal protector or hunting\
  \ hound in time. Train it well, mind you, for the worg are smart and never\
  \ quite free of their primal urges."
