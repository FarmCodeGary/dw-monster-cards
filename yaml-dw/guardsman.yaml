description: "Noble protector or merely drunken lout, it often makes no\
  \ difference to these sorts. Falling shy of a noble knight, the proud\
  \ town guard is an ancient profession nonetheless. These folks of the\
  \ constabulary often dress in the colors of their lord (when you can see\
  \ it under the mud) and, depending on the richness of that lord, might\
  \ even have a decent weapon and some armor that fits. Those are the lucky\
  \ ones. Even so, someone has to be there to keep an eye on the gate when\
  \ the Black Riders have been spotted in the woods. Too many of us owe\
  \ our lives to these souls\u2014remember that the next time one is drunkenly\
  \ insulting your mother, hmm?"
