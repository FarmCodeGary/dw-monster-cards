description: "The triton are not a militant race by nature. They shy away\
  \ from battle except when the sahuagin attack, and then they only defend\
  \ themselves and retreat into the depths where their foes can\u2019t follow.\
  \ This trend begins to change. As the tidecallers come to rally their\
  \ people, some triton men and women take up arms. They call these generals\
  \ \u201Csub-mariners\u201D and build for them armor of shells and hardened\
  \ glass. They swim in formation, wielding pikes and harpoons and attack\
  \ the crews of ships that wander too far from port. Watch for their pennants\
  \ of kelp on the horizon and the conch-cry of a call to battle and keep,\
  \ if you can, your boats near shore."
