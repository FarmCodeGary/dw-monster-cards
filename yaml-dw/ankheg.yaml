description: "A hide like plate armor and great crushing mandibles are problematic.\
  \ A stomach full of acid that can burn a hole through a stone wall makes\
  \ them all the worse. They\u2019d be bad enough if they were proper insect-sized,\
  \ but these things have the gall to be as long as any given horse. It\u2019\
  s just not natural! Good thing they tend to stick to one place? Easy for\
  \ you to say\u2014you don\u2019t have an ankheg living under your corn\
  \ field."
