description: "We call to the elements. We call on fire, ever-burning. We\
  \ summon water, life-giving. We beseech the earth, stable-standing. We\
  \ cry to the air, forever-changing. These elements we recognize and give\
  \ our thanks but ask to pass. The elemental we call upon this night knows\
  \ another name. We call upon the element of Night. Shadow, we name you.\
  \ Death\u2019s messenger and black assassin, we claim for our own. Accept\
  \ our sacrifice and do our bidding \u2019til the morning come."
