description: "There\u2019s not but one person in all the King\u2019s court\
  \ allowed to speak the truth. The real, straight-and-honest truth about\
  \ anything. The fool couches it all in bells and prancing and chalky face-paint,\
  \ but who else gets to tell the King what\u2019s what? You can trust a\
  \ fool, they say, especially when he\u2019s made you red-faced and you\u2019\
  d just as soon drown him in a cesspit."
