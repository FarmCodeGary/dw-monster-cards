description: "The wilds are home to more than just beasts of horn and scale.\
  \ There are men and women out there, too\u2014those who smell blood on\
  \ the wind and stalk the plains in the skins of their prey. Whether with\
  \ a trusty longbow bought on a rare trip into the city or with a knife\
  \ of bone and sinew, these folk have more in common with the things they\
  \ track and eat than with their own kind. Solemn, somber and quiet, they\
  \ find a sort of peace in the wild."
