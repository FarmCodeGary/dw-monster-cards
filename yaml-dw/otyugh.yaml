description: "The mating call of the otyugh is a horrible, blaring cry that\
  \ sounds like a cross between an elephant dying and an over-eager vulture.\
  \ The otyugh spends much of its time partly submerged in filthy water\
  \ and prefers eating garbage over any other food. As a result, it often\
  \ grows fat and strong on the offal of orcs, goblins and other cave-dwelling\
  \ sub-humans. Get too close, however, and you\u2019ll have one of its\
  \ barbed tentacles dragging you into that soggy, razor-toothed maw. If\
  \ you get away with your life, best get to a doctor, or your victory may\
  \ be short lived."
