description: The spirits of the trees and the lady sunlight are far, far
  from home in the depths where the deep elves dwell. New gods were found
  there, waiting for their children to come home. Gods of the spiders, the
  fungal forests, and things that whisper in the forbidden caves. The deep
  elves, ever attuned to the world around them, listened with hateful intent
  to their new gods and found a new source of power. Hate calls to hate
  and grim alliances were made. Even among these spiteful ranks, piety finds
  a way to express itself.
