description: "Well-known and categorized, the chimera is a perfected creature.\
  \ From the codices of the Mage\u2019s Guild to the famous pages of Cullaina\u2019\
  s Creature Compendium, there\u2019s no confusion about what chimera means.\
  \ Two parts lioness, one part serpent, head of a she-goat, and all the\
  \ vicious magic one can muster. The actual ritual might vary, as might\
  \ a detail or two\u2014more creative sorcerers switch the flame breath\
  \ for acid, perhaps. Used as a guardian, an assassin or merely an instrument\
  \ of chaos unchained, it matters little. The chimera is the worst sort\
  \ of abomination: an intentional affront to all natural life."
