description: "What? Did you think they were all a mile long? Did you think\
  \ they didn\u2019t come smaller than that? Sure, they may be no bigger\
  \ than a dog and no smarter than an ape, but a dragon whelp can still\
  \ belch up a hellish ball of fire that\u2019ll melt your armor shut and\
  \ drop you screaming into the mud. Their scales, too, are softer than\
  \ those of their bigger kin, but can still turn aside an arrow or sword\
  \ not perfectly aimed. Size is not the only measure of might."
