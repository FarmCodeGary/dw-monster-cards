description: "Among the animals there exists a clear division \u2018tween\
  \ hunter and hunted. All it takes is a glance to know\u2014by fangs and\
  \ glowing eyes or claws or venomous sting\u2014which of the creatures\
  \ of this world are meant to kill and which stand to be killed. Such a\
  \ split, if you have the eyes to see it, cuts the world of leaves and\
  \ flowers in twain, as well. Druids in their forest circles know it. Rangers,\
  \ too, might spot such a plant before it\u2019s too late. Lay folk, though,\
  \ they wander where they oughtn\u2019t\u2014paths into the deep woods\
  \ covered in creeping vines and with a snap, these hungry ropes snap tight,\
  \ dragging their meaty prey into the underbrush. Mind your feet, traveller."
