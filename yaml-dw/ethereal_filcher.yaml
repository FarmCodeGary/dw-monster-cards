description: "Things go missing. A sock, a silver spoon, your dead mother\u2019\
  s bones. We blame the maid, or bad luck, or just a moment of stupid forgetfulness\
  \ and we move on. We never get to see the real cause of these problems.\
  \ The spidery thing with human hands and eyes as blue as the deep Ethereal\
  \ plane from whence the creature comes. We never see the nest it makes\
  \ of astral silver webbing and stolen objects arranged in some mad pattern.\
  \ We never watch it assemble its collection of halfling finger-bones,\
  \ stolen from the hands of the sleeping. We\u2019re lucky, that way."
