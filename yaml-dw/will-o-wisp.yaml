description: "Spot a lantern floating in the darkness, lost traveler in\
  \ the swamp. Hope\u2014a beacon of shimmering light. You call out to it,\
  \ but there\u2019s no answer. It begins to fade and so you follow, sloshing\
  \ through the muck, tiring at the chase, hoping you\u2019re being led\
  \ to safety. Such a sad tale that always ends in doom. These creatures\
  \ are a mystery\u2014some say they\u2019re ghosts, others beacons of faerie\
  \ light. Nobody knows the truth. They are cruel, however. All can agree\
  \ on that."
