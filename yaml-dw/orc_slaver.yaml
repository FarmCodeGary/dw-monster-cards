description: "Red sails fly in the southern sea. Red sails and ships of\
  \ bone, old wood and iron. The warfleet of the horde. Orcs down that way\
  \ have taken to the sea, harassing island towns and stealing away with\
  \ fishermen and their kin. It\u2019s said the custom is spreading north\
  \ and the orcs learn the value of free work. Taken to it like a sacred\
  \ duty\u2014especially if they can get their hands on elves. Hard to think\
  \ of a grimmer fate than to live out your life on an orcish galley, back\
  \ bent under the lash."
