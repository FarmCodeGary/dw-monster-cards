description: "The Tarrasque. Legendary unstoppable juggernaut\u2014eater\
  \ of cities and swallower of ships, horses, and knights. A creature unseen\
  \ in an age but about whom all kinds of stories are told. One thread of\
  \ truth weaves through these stories. It cannot be killed. No blade can\
  \ pierce its stony shell nor spell penetrate the shield it somehow bears.\
  \ Stories say, though, that the will of one pure soul can send it to slumber,\
  \ though what that means and, by the gods, where such a thing might be\
  \ found, pray we do not ever need to learn. It slumbers. Somewhere in\
  \ the periphery of the planar edge, it sleeps for now."
