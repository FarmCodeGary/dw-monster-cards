description: "The deep elves lost the sweetness and gentle peace of their\
  \ bright cousins ages ago, but they did not abandon grace. They move with\
  \ a swiftness and beauty that would bring a tear to any warrior\u2019\
  s eye. In the dark, they\u2019ve practiced. A cruelty has infested their\
  \ swordsmanship\u2014a wickedness comes to the fore. Barbed blades and\
  \ whips replace the shining pennant-spears of elven battles on the surface.\
  \ The swordmasters of the deep elf clans do not merely seek to kill, but\
  \ to punish with every stroke of their blades. Wickedness and pain are\
  \ their currency."
