description: "Once they scent your blood, you can\u2019t escape. Not without\
  \ intervention from the gods, or the duke\u2019s rangers at least. The\
  \ desert scrub is a dangerous place to go exploring on your own and if\
  \ you fall and break your leg or eat the wrong cactus, well, you\u2019\
  ll be lucky if you die of thirst before the gnolls find you. They prefer\
  \ their prey alive, see\u2014cracking bones and the screams of the dying\
  \ lend a sort of succulence to a meal. Sickening creatures, no? They\u2019\
  ll hunt you, slow and steady, as you die. If you hear laughter in the\
  \ desert wind, well, best pray Death comes to take you before they do."
