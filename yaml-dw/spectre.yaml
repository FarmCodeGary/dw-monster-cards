description: "For some folk, when they pass, Death himself cannot release\
  \ their grip on the places they love most. A priest whose devotion to\
  \ the temple is greater than that of his god. A banking guild official\
  \ who cannot bear to part with his vault. A drunk and his favorite tavern.\
  \ All make excellent spectres. They act not out of the usual hunger that\
  \ drives the undead, but jealousy. Jealousy that anyone else might come\
  \ to love their home as much as they do and drive them out. These places\
  \ belong to them and these invisible spirits will kill before they\u2019\
  ll let anyone send them to their rest."
