description: "Ambitious and territorial above nearly all else, the naga\
  \ are very rarely found without a well-formed and insidious cult of followers.\
  \ You\u2019ll see it in many mountain towns\u2014a snake sigil scrawled\
  \ on a tavern wall or a local church burned to the ground. People going\
  \ missing in the mines. Men and women wearing the mark of the serpent.\
  \ At the core of it all lies a naga: an old race now fallen into obscurity,\
  \ still preening with the head of a man over its coiled, serpent body.\
  \ Variations of these creatures exist depending on their bloodline and\
  \ original purpose, but they are all master manipulators and magical forces\
  \ to be reckoned with."
