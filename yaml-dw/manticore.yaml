description: "If the chimera is the first step down a dark path, the manticore\
  \ is a door that can\u2019t be closed once it\u2019s been opened. A lion,\
  \ a scorpion, the wings of a drake. All difficult to obtain but not impossible\
  \ and just animals, anyway. The last component, the hissing hateful face\
  \ of the beast, is the ingredient that makes a manticore so cruel. Young\
  \ or old, man or woman, it matters not but that they are human, living\
  \ and breathing, married to the creature with twisted magic. All sense\
  \ of who they are is lost, and maybe that\u2019s a blessing, but the beast\
  \ is born from human suffering. No wonder, then, that they\u2019re all\
  \ so eager to kill."
