description: "The tusks of the razor boar shred metal plate like so much\
  \ tissue. Voracious, savage and unstoppable, they tower over their mundane\
  \ kin. To kill one? A greater trophy of bravery and skill is hard to name,\
  \ though I hear a razor boar killed the Drunkard King in a single thrust.\
  \ You think you\u2019re a better hunter than he?"
