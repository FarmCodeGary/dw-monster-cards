description: "Like the nightwing, the wight-wolf is a creature not spawned\
  \ in our world. Somehow slipping the seals of the Black Gates of Death,\
  \ these spirits take the shape of massive hounds or shadowy wolves and\
  \ hunt the living for sport. They travel in packs, led by a mighty alpha,\
  \ but bear a kind of intelligence unknown to true canines. Their wild\
  \ hunts draw the attention of intelligent undead\u2014liches, vampires\
  \ and the like\u2014who will sometimes make pacts with the alpha and serve\
  \ a grim purpose together. Listen for the baying of the hounds of Death\
  \ and pray that they do not howl for you."
