description: "One of only a very few creatures to be found in the old woods\
  \ that don\u2019t outright want to maim, kill, or eat us. They dwell in\
  \ glades pierced by the sun, and dance on their funny goat-legs to enchanting\
  \ music played on pipes made of bone and silver. They smile easily and,\
  \ so long as you please them with jokes and sport, will treat our kind\
  \ with friendliness. They\u2019ve a mean streak, though, so if you cross\
  \ them, make haste elsewhere; very few things hold a grudge like the stubborn\
  \ satyr."
