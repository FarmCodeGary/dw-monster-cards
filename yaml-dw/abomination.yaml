description: "Corpses sewn onto corpses make up the bulk of these shambling\
  \ masses of dark magic. Most undead are crafted to be controlled\u2014\
  made to serve some purpose like building a tower or serving as guardians.\
  \ Not so the abomination. The last aspect of the ritual used to grant\
  \ fire to their hellish limbs invokes a hatred so severe that the abomination\
  \ knows but one task: to tear and rend at the very thing it cannot have\u2014\
  life. Many students of the black arts learn to their mortal dismay the\
  \ most important fact about these hulks; an abomination knows no master."
