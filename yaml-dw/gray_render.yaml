description: On its own, the render is a force of utter destruction. Huge
  and leathery, with a maw of unbreakable teeth and claws to match, the
  render seems to enjoy little more than tearing things apart. Stone, flesh,
  or steel, it matters little. However, the gray render is so rarely found
  alone. They bond with other creatures. Some at birth, others as fully-grown
  creatures, and a gray render will follow their bonded master wherever
  they go, bringing them offerings of meat and protecting them while they
  sleep. Finding an un-bonded render means certain riches, if you survive
  to sell it.
