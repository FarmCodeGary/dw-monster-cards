description: "The herd came from a pact made in the days when folk still\
  \ inhabited the Blasted Steppes. Horselords, they were, who travelled\
  \ those lands. Born in the saddle, it was said. One of theirs, in a bid\
  \ to dominate his peers, made a black pact with some fell power and traded\
  \ away his finest horses. He had some power, sure\u2014but what\u2019\
  s a thousand year dynasty when a life is so short? Now the fiends of the\
  \ pit ride on the finest horses ever seen. Coats of shining oil and manes\
  \ of tormented flame: these are steeds of hell\u2019s cavalry."
