description: "Not every attack by orcs is torches and screaming and enslavement.\
  \ Among those who follow He of Riven Sight, poison and murder-in-the-dark\
  \ are considered sacred arts. Enter the shadowhunter. Orcs cloaked in\
  \ Night\u2019s magic who slip into camps, towns and temples and end the\
  \ lives of those within. Do not be so distracted by the howling of the\
  \ berserkers that you don\u2019t notice the knife at your back."
