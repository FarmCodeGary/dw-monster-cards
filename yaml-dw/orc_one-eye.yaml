description: "In the name of He of Riven Sight and by the First Sacrifice\
  \ of Elf-Flesh do we invoke the Old Powers. By the Second Sacrifice, I\
  \ make my claim to what is mine\u2014the dark magic of Night. In His image,\
  \ I walk the path to Gor-sha-thak, the Iron Gallows! I call to the runes!\
  \ I call to the clouded sky! Take this mortal organ, eat of the flesh\
  \ of our enemy and give me what is mine!"
