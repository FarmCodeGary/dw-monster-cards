description: "The medusa are children of a serpent-haired mother, birthing\
  \ them in ancient times to bear her name across the ages. They dwell near\
  \ places of civilization\u2014luring folks to their caves with promises\
  \ of beauty or riches untold. Fine appreciators of art, the medusa curate\
  \ strange collections of their victims, terror or ecstasy frozen forever\
  \ in stone. It satisfies their vanity to know they were the last thing\
  \ seen in so many lives. Arrogant, proud, and spiteful, in their way,\
  \ they seek what so many do\u2014endless company."
