description: "More beautiful by far than any man or woman born in the civil\
  \ realms. To gaze upon one is to fall in love. Deep and punishing, too.\
  \ Thing is, they don\u2019t love\u2014not the fleshy folk who often find\
  \ them, anyway. Their love is a primal thing, married to the woods\u2014\
  to a great oak that serves as home and mother and sacred place to them.\
  \ It\u2019s a curse to see one, too, they\u2019ll never love you back.\
  \ No matter what you do. No matter how you pledge yourself to them, they\u2019\
  ll always spurn you. If ever their oak comes to harm, you\u2019ve not\
  \ only the dryad\u2019s wrath to contend with, but in every nearby village\
  \ there\u2019s a score of men with a secret longing in their heart, ready\
  \ to murder you where you sleep for just a smile from such a creature."
