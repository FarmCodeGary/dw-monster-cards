description: "Oh, an emissary! How nice. I suspect you didn\u2019t know\
  \ the gnolls had ambassadors, did you? Yes, even these mangy hyenas have\
  \ to make nice sometimes. No, no, not with us. Nor the dwarves, neither.\
  \ No, the emissary is the one, among his packmates, who trucks directly\
  \ with their dripping demon lord. Frightening? Too right. Every hound\
  \ has a master with his hand on the chain. This gnoll hears his master\u2019\
  s voice. Hears it and obeys."
