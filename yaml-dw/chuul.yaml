description: Your worst seafood nightmare come to life. A vicious sort of
  half-man half-crawdad, cursed with primal intelligence and blessed with
  a pair of razor-sharp claws. Strange things lurk in the stinking pools
  in caverns best forgotten and the chuul is one of them. If you spot one,
  your best hope is a heavy mace to crack its shell and maybe a little garlic
  butter. Mmmm.
