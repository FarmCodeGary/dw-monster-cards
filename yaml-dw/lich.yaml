description: "\u201CAt the end, they give you a scroll and a jeweled medallion\
  \ to commemorate your achievements. Grand Master of Abjuration, I was\
  \ called, then. Old man. Weak and wizened and just a bit too senile for\
  \ them\u2014those jealous halfwits. Barely apprentices, and they called\
  \ themselves The New Council. It makes me sick, or would, if I still could\
  \ be. They told me it was an honor and I would be remembered forever.\
  \ It was like listening to my own eulogy. Fitting, in a way, don\u2019\
  t you think? It took me another ten years to learn the rituals and another\
  \ four to collect the material and you see before you the fruits of my\
  \ labor. I endure. I live. I will see the death of this age and the dawn\
  \ of the next. It pains me to have to do this, but, you see, you cannot\
  \ be permitted to endanger my research. When you meet Death, say hello\
  \ for me, would you?\u201D"
