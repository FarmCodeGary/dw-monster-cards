description: "\u201CI ain\u2019t ever seen such a thing, sir. Rodrick thought\
  \ it a chicken, maybe. Poor Rodrick. I figured it to be a lizard of a\
  \ sort, though he was right\u2014it had a beak and gray feathers like\
  \ a chicken. Right, well, see, we found it in the woods, in a nest at\
  \ the foot of a tree while we were out with the sow. Looking for mushrooms,\
  \ sir. I told Rodrick we were\u2014yes, sir, right sir, the bird\u2014\
  see, it was glaring at Rodrick and he tried to scare it off with a stick\
  \ to steal the eggs but the thing pecked his hand. Quick it was, too.\
  \ I tried to get him away but he just got slower and slower and\u2026\
  yes, as you see him now, sir. All frozen up like when we left the dog\
  \ out overnight in winter two years back. Poor, stupid Rodrick. Weren\u2019\
  t no bird nor lizard, were it, sir?\u201D"
