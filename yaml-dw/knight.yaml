description: "What youngster doesn\u2019t cling to the rail at the mighty\
  \ joust, blinded by the sun on their glittering armor, wishing they could\
  \ be the one adorned in steel and riding to please the King and Queen?\
  \ What peasant youth with naught but a loaf of bread and a lame sow doesn\u2019\
  t wish to trade it all in for the lance and the bright pennant? A knight\
  \ is many things\u2014a holy warrior, a sworn sword, a villain sometimes,\
  \ too, but a knight cannot help but be a symbol to all who see her. A\
  \ knight means something."
