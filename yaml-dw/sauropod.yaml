description: Great lumbering beasts, they live in places long since forgotten
  by the thinking races of the world. Gentle if unprovoked, but mighty if
  their ire is raised, they trample smaller creatures with the care we might
  give to crushing an ant beneath our boots. If you see one, drift by and
  gaze in awe, but do not wake the giant.
