description: "A fishing village caught one in their net, some time ago.\
  \ Part a man and part some scaly sea creature, it spoke in a broken, spy-learned\
  \ form of the common tongue before it suffocated in the open air. It told\
  \ the fishermen of a coming tide, an inescapable swell of the power of\
  \ some deep-sea god and that the triton empire would rise up and drag\
  \ the land down into the ocean. The tale spread and now, when fishermen\
  \ sail the choppy seas, they watch and worry that the dying triton\u2019\
  s tales were true. That there are powers deep below that watch and wait.\
  \ They fear the tide is coming in."
