description: "Not all those who wield the arcane arts are adventuring wizards.\
  \ Nor necromancers in mausoleums or sorcerers of ancient bloodline. Some\
  \ are just old men and women, smart enough to have discovered a trick\
  \ or two. It might make them a bit batty to come by that knowledge, but\
  \ if you\u2019ve a curse to break or a love to prove, might be that a\
  \ hedge wizard will help you, if you can find his rotten hut in the swamp\
  \ and pay the price he asks."
