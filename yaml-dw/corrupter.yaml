description: "\u201CSurely, my good man, you must know why I am here. Must\
  \ know who I am. You said the words. You spilled the blood and followed\
  \ the instructions almost to the letter. Your pronunciation was a bit\
  \ off but that\u2019s to be expected. I\u2019ve come to give you what\
  \ you\u2019ve always wanted, friend. Glory, love, money? Paltry things\
  \ when you\u2019ve the vaults of hell to plumb. Don\u2019t look so shocked,\
  \ you knew what this was. You have but one thing we desire. Promise it\
  \ to us, and the world shall be yours for the taking. Trust me.\u201D"
