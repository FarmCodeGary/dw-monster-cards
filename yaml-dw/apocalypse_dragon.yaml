description: "The end of all things shall be a burning\u2014of tree and\
  \ earth and of the air itself. It shall come upon the plains and mountains\
  \ not from beyond this world but from within it. Birthed from the womb\
  \ of deepest earth shall come the Dragon that Will End the World. In its\
  \ passing all will become ash and bile and the Dungeon World a dying thing\
  \ will drift through planar space devoid of life. They say to worship\
  \ the Apocalypse Dragon is to invite madness. They say to love it is to\
  \ know oblivion. The awakening is coming."
