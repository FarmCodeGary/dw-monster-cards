description: "Stolen bits and pieces in the night. Graveyards stealthily\
  \ uprooted and maybe tonight an arm, a leg, another head (the last one\
  \ came apart too soon). Even the humblest hedge-enchanter can make do\
  \ with what he can and, with a little creativity, well\u2014it\u2019s\
  \ not only the college that can make life, hmm? We\u2019ll show them."
