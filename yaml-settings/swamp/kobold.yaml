description: "Some are wont to lump these little, rat-like dragon-men in\
  \ with goblins and orcs, bugbears and hobgoblins. They are smarter and\
  \ wiser than their kin, however. The kobolds are beholden slaves to dragons\
  \ and were, in ancient times, their lorekeepers and sorcerer-servants.\
  \ Their clans, with  names like Ironscale and Whitewing, form around a\
  \ dragon master and live to serve and do its bidding. Spotting a kobold\
  \ means more are near\u2014and if more are near then a mighty dragon cannot\
  \ be far, either."
