description: "These strange creatures are no bigger or smarter than their\
  \ mundane kin. They have the same vicious nature. Over their relations\
  \ they have one advantage\u2014an oily secretion that oozes from their\
  \ skin. It makes them hard to catch. On top of that, with a twist of their\
  \ body they can ignite the stuff, leaving pools of burning oil atop the\
  \ surface of the water and roasting prey and predator alike. I hear the\
  \ slimy things make good ingredients for fire-resistant gear, but you\
  \ have to get your hands on one, first."
