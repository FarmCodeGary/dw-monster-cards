description: "A traveling sorcerer once told me that lizardmen came before\
  \ we did. That before elves and dwarves and men built even the first of\
  \ their wattle huts, a race of proud lizard kings strode the land. That\
  \ they lived in palaces of crystal and worshipped their own scaly gods.\
  \ Maybe that\u2019s true and maybe it ain\u2019t\u2014now they dwell in\
  \ places men long forgot or abandoned, crafting tools from volcano-glass\
  \ and lashing against the works of the civilized world. Maybe they just\
  \ want back what they lost."
