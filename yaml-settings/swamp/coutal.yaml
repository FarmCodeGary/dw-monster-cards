description: "As if in direct defiance of the decay and filth of the world,\
  \ the gods granted us the coutal. As if to say, \u201Cthere is beauty,\
  \ even in this grim place.\u201D A serpent in flight on jeweled wings,\
  \ these beautiful creatures glow with a soft light, as the sun does through\
  \ stained glass. Bright, wise, and calm, a coutal often knows many things\
  \ and sees many more. You might be able to make a trade with it in exchange\
  \ for some favor. They seek to cleanse and to purge and to make of this\
  \ dark world a better one. Shame we have so few. The gods are cruel."
