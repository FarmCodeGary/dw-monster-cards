description: "For ages, men believed all dwarves were male and all were\
  \ of this ilk: stoic and proud warriors. Axe-wielding and plate-wearing.\
  \ Stout bearded battle-hungry dwarves who would push them, time and time\
  \ again, back up out of their mines and tunnels with ferocity. It just\
  \ goes to show how little men know about the elder races. These folk are\
  \ merely a vanguard, and they bravely do their duty to protect the riches\
  \ of the Dwarven realm. Earn their trust and you\u2019ve an ally for life.\
  \ Earn their ire and you\u2019re not likely to regret it very long."
