description: "It\u2019s okay, magical experimentation is a messy science.\
  \ For every beautiful pegasus there\u2019s a half-done creature that wasn\u2019\
  t quite right. We understand. The goblin-elephant you thought was such\
  \ a great idea. The Gelatinous Drake. Just examples. No judgement here.\
  \ Anyway, we\u2019ve got something for that. We call it the Digester.\
  \ Yes, just like it sounds. Strange looking, I know, and the smell isn\u2019\
  t the best, but this thing\u2014it\u2019ll eat magic like Svenloff the\
  \ Stout drinks ale. Next time one of these unfortunate accidents occurs,\
  \ just point the Digester at it and all your troubles drain away. Just\
  \ keep an eye on it. Damn thing ate my wand last week."
