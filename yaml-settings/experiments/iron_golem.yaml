description: "A staple of the enchanter\u2019s art. Every golemist and mechano-thaumaturge\
  \ in the kingdoms knows this. Iron is a misnomer, though. These guardians\
  \ are crafted of any metal, really: steel, copper, or even gold, in some\
  \ small cases. As much an art as a science, the crafting of a fine golem\
  \ is as respected in the Kingdoms as a bridge newly built or a castle\
  \ erected in the mountains. Unceasing watchdog, stalwart defender, the\
  \ iron golem lives to serve, following its orders eternally. Any enchanter\
  \ worth his salt can craft one, if he can afford the materials. If not\u2026"
