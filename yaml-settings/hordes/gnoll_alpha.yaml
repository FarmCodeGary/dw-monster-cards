description: "Every pack has its top dog. Bigger, maybe\u2014that\u2019\
  d be the simplest way. Often, though, with these lank and filthy mutts,\
  \ it\u2019s not about size or sharp teeth but about cruelty. About a willingness\
  \ to kill your brothers and eat them while the pack watches. Willingness\
  \ to desecrate the pack in a way that cows them to you. If they\u2019\
  re that awful to each other\u2014to their living kin\u2014think about\
  \ how they must view us. It\u2019s hard to be mere meat in a land of carnivores."
