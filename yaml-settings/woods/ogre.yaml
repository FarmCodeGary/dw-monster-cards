description: 'A tale, then. Somewhere in the not-so-long history of the
  mannish race there was a divide. In days when men were merely dwellers-in-the-mud
  with no magic to call their own, they split in two: one camp left their
  caves and the dark forests and built the first city to honor the gods.
  The others, a wild and savage lot, retreated into darkness. They grew,
  there. In the deep woods a grim loathing for their softer kin gave them
  strength. They found dark gods of their own, there in the woods and hills.
  Ages passed and they bred tall and strong and full of hate. We have forged
  steel and they match it with their savagery. We may have forgotten our
  common roots, but somewhere, deep down, the ogres remember.'
