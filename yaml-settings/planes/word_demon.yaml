description: "All of mortal magic is just words. Spells are prayers, rote\
  \ formula, runes cast, or songs sung. Letters, words, sentences, and syntax\
  \ strung together in a language that the whole world itself might understand.\
  \ By way of words we can make our fellows cry or exult, can paint pictures\
  \ and whisper desire to the gods. No little wonder, then, that in all\
  \ that power is intent. That every word we utter, if repeated and meaning\
  \ or emotion given to it, can spark a kind of unintentional summoning.\
  \ Word daemons are called by accident, appear at random and are often\
  \ short-lived, but come to attend a particular word. Capricious, unpredictable\
  \ and dangerous, yes\u2014but possibly useful, depending on the word."
