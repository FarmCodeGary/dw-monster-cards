description: Those who have seen visions of the Planes Below, and survived
  with their sanity intact, speak of masses of these writhing wretches.
  Maggots with the faces of men and women, crying out for salvation in a
  nest of flames. Sometimes, they can be goaded out through a rip in the
  planar caul and emerge, wriggling and in torment, into our world. Once
  here, they spread misery and sickness during their mayfly lives before
  expiring into a slurry of gore. All in all, an enticement to do good deeds
  in life.
