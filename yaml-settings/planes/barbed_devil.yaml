description: "There are a thousand forms of devil, maybe more. Some common\
  \ and some unique. Each time the Inquisitors discover a new one they write\
  \ it into the Tormentors Codex and the knowledge is shared among the abbeys\
  \ in the hope that atrocities of that particular sort won\u2019t find\
  \ their way into the world again. The barbed devil has long been known\
  \ to the brothers and sisters of the Inquisition. It appears only at a\
  \ site of great violence or when called by a wayward summoner. Covered\
  \ in sharp quills, this particular demon revels in the spilling of blood,\
  \ preferably by impaling victims piecemeal or in whole upon its thorns\
  \ and letting them die there. Cruel but not particularly effective beyond\
  \ slaughter. A low inquisitorial priority."
