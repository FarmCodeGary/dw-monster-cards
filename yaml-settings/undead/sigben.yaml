description: "\u201CAswang-hound and hopping whip-tail! Sent by vampires\
  \ on their two, twisted legs, these ugly things look like the head of\
  \ a rat or a crocodile, maybe, furry though and sharp of tooth. They have\
  \ withered wings, but cannot use them and long, whipping tails, spurred\
  \ with poison tips. Stupid, vengeful and mischievous they cause all kinds\
  \ of chaos when let out of the strange clay jars in which they\u2019re\
  \ born. Only a vampire could love such a wretched thing.\u201D"
