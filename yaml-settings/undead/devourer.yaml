description: "Most folk know that the undead feed on flesh. The warmth,\
  \ blood and living tissue continue their unholy existence. This is true\
  \ for most of the mindless dead, animated by black sorcery. Not so the\
  \ devourer. When a particularly wicked person (often a manipulator of\
  \ men, an apostate priest or the like) dies in a gruesome way, the dark\
  \ powers of Dungeon World might bring them back to a kind of life. The\
  \ devourer, however, does not feed on the flesh of men or elves. The devourer\
  \ eats souls. It kills with a pleasure only the sentient can enjoy and\
  \ in the moments of its victims\u2019 expiry, draws breath like a drowning\
  \ man and swallows a soul. What does it mean to have your soul eaten by\
  \ such a creature? None dare ask for fear of finding out."
