description: "Are they granted their place by the gods, perhaps? Is that\
  \ why they\u2019re able to pass their riches and power down by birth?\
  \ Some trick or enchantment of the blood, maybe. The peasant bends his\
  \ knee and scrapes and toils and the noble wears the finery of his place\
  \ and, they say, we all have our burdens to bear. Seems to me that some\
  \ of us have burdens of stone and some carry their weight in gold. It\u2019\
  s a tough life."
