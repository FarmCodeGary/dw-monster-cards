description: "Covered in muck, downtrodden at the bottom of the great chain\
  \ of being, we all stand on the backs of those who grow our food on their\
  \ farms. Some peasants do better than others, but none will ever see a\
  \ coin of gold in their day. They\u2019ll dream at night of how someday,\
  \ somehow, they\u2019ll fight a dragon and save a princess. Don\u2019\
  t act like you weren\u2019t one before you lost what little sense you\
  \ had, adventurer."
